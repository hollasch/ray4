====================================================================================================

This is `ray4`, a 4D raytracer I wrote for my masterâ€™s thesis in May 1991
([_Four-Space Visualization of 4D Objects_][thesis]).

  | [ray4-c/][] | Original C raytracer distributed with the thesis |
  | src/        | Source code for ray4, image4 and unit tests      |


Building
---------
This project now builds with CMake, which should allow the code to work on all CMake-supported
platforms. Build from the `/ray4/ray4/` directory.


Testing
--------
This project includes unit tests created with the Catch2 unit-testing library. These tests can be
executed by running `build/Debug/tests.exe` or `build/Release/tests.exe`.


Example Run
-----------

    ray4 -b12 -idots.r4 -odots.icube -a10:11:20 -r78:65:12
    r4toiff dots.icube -t


Image4
-------
This project also includes [`image4`][], a tool to work with the 3D image cubes generated by `ray4`.
