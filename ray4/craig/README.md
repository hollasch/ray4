     NOTE:  To convert ray4 image files to SUN rasterfile, you need the
PBM graphics package - See below for info.

     run and run2 are sample scripts that can be used to run ray4 in the
background.  For example "run dots" will raytrace the dots.r4 input file
in the background redirecting all screen output to the file "temp" and
saving the ray4 image file as "dots.icube".

     To convert ray4 image data files to MTV format, use "r4tomtv".  r4tomtv
uses the same command line arguments as r4tosgi.  It will create MTV files
whose name is of the form:  
     slice_(data file prefix)_(zplane) 
for example:  slice_dots_0 would be the 0 zplane slice of the dots.icube
file.

     To convert an individual MTV file to SUN rasterfile, use mtvtorast.
for example:  "mtvtorast slice_dots_0" will create the SUN rasterfile 
named "slice_dots_0.ras".  "screenload slice_dots_0.ras" will display the
image on a SUN.

     convert will convert all slice MTV files to SUN rasterfile automatically.
It also will delete all MTV slice files if the user responds with "y" to
the delete files prompt.

     To display an individual MTV file on a SUN screen without saving to
a SUN rasterfile, use "display".  For example:  "display slice_dots_0"
will convert and display the slice.
