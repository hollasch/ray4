Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        The wire4 program was developed in conjunction with my master's
    thesis on "Four-Space Visualization of 4D Objects", May, 1991, at
    Arizona State University for the Computer Science Department.

        This program allows for the interactive display of 4D wireframe
    objects.  It provides for 3D and 4D rotations, 3D and 4D parallel &
    perspective projection, depthcueing, and other operations.  The user
    provides the 4D object definition and has control over both
    structure, display modes, and object edge coloring.

        For information about the underlying mathematics and algorithms
    implemented in this program, refer to the master's thesis mentioned
    above.  This thesis is available via anonymous ftp from the paper
    bank at nic.funet.fi.

        In the remainder of this document, example input file statements
    will be preceded with the bar character, e.g.:

        |  This is an input file line.
        |  So is this.




Target Platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        This program uses GL for the graphics output and user input.  It
    has been tested on the SGI 3130, SGI 4D, SGI 310 VGX, and IBM RS/6000
    (with the SGI Sabine (Turbo) card, NOT with the GTO card).



Input File Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        The input file format is free form -- whitespace characters may
    occur at any position in the input file.  Whitespace characters
    include formfeed, newline, carriage return, tab, space, colon,
    semi-colon, forward slash, and comma.

        Comments are bounded by the '#' character and the next newline
    character.

        Input statements consist of a keyword, followed by some
    arguments.  Supported keywords include the following:

        ColorFar        <RGB>
        ColorMap        <Color # [1,255]> <RGB>
        ColorNear       <RGB>
        Depthcue        <"On" / "Off">
        DepthcueLevels  <Integer [1,255]>
        DepthFar        <Real>
        DepthNear       <Real>
        EdgeList        <# of Edges> <Vertex #> <Vertex #> <Color #>
                                 ... <Vertex #> <Vertex #> <Color #>
        From3           <3D Point>
        From4           <4D Point>
        Over4           <4D Vector>
        Project3        <"Parallel" / "Perspective">
        Project4        <"Parallel" / "Perspective">
        RefCube         <"On" / "Off">
        To3             <3D Point>
        To4             <4D Point>
        Up3             <3D Vector>
        Up4             <4D Vector>
        Vangle3         <Real (0.0,180.0)>
        Vangle4         <Real (0.0,180.0)>
        VertexList      <# of Vertices> <4D Point> ... <4D Point>

        Keywords may be supplied in mixed case; wire4 does not
    distinguish between uppercase and lowercase.  The parameters are
    defined as follows:

        <RGB>       :  <Red [0,255]> <Green [0,255> <Blue [0,255]>
        <3D Point>  :  <Real> <Real> <Real>
        <4D Point>  :  <Real> <Real> <Real> <Real>
        <3D Vector> :  <Real> <Real> <Real>
        <4D Vector> :  <Real> <Real> <Real> <Real>

        The coordinates are given in left-handed coordinates; the Z axis
    points into the screen.  The analogous situation holds for the 4D
    coordinates.




Object Definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        The 4D object wireframe definition is given in the input file as
    a sequence of vertices and a sequence of edges connecting pairs of
    the given vertices.
    
        The vertex list is specified with the "VertexList" keyword.  The
    keyword is followed by the number of vertices in the 4D object, and
    then by the 4D points of each vertex.  Vertices are numbered from
    0 to N-1, e.g.:

        |  VertexList  4
        |      1.0  0.0  0.0  0.0       # Vertex 0
        |      1.0  1.0  0.0  0.0       # Vertex 1
        |      1.0  1.0  1.0  0.0       # Vertex 2
        |      1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0       # Vertex 3

        The edges of the 4D object wireframe are given with the EdgeList
    statement.  The "EdgeList" keyword is followed by the number of edges
    in the 4D object wireframe, then by two vertices and a color index
    for each edge, e.g.:

        |  EdgeList  6
        |      0,1 : 1     # Vertex 0 --> Vertex 1;  Color #1
        |      1,2 : 1     # Vertex 1 --> Vertex 2;  Color #1
        |      2,3 : 1     # Vertex 2 --> Vertex 3;  Color #1
        |      3,0 : 1     # Vertex 3 --> Vertex 0;  Color #1
        |      0,2 : 2     # Vertex 0 --> Vertex 2;  Color #2
        |      1,3 : 2     # Vertex 1 --> Vertex 3;  Color #2

        The color list is built via the "ColorMap" keyword.  The colormap
    statement specifies a given color index and the RGB value of that
    color.  The RGB components may range from 0 to 255.  The number of
    available colors depends on the graphics display device, but on the
    Silicon Graphics Iris 3130, there are 255 available colors (1 - 255).
    Colormap statements look like this:

        |  Colormap  1  100 100 100       # Color 1 is grey.
        |  Colormap  2  175  40 225       # Color 2 is violet.
        |  Colormap  3  235 150  70       # Color 3 is orange.




View Definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        There are two separate views of the 4D object:  one in four-
    space, and one in three-space.  The object is first projected from
    four-space to an intermediate 3D viewing region that corresponds to
    the cube with vertices <+-1, +-1, +-1, +-1>.  This projection is
    governed by the 4D viewing parameters.

        The projection of the 4D object is then further projected to the
    2D display device viewport, and is governed by the 3D viewing
    parameters.

        The 3D viewing parameters consist of From3, To3, Up3 and Vangle3.
    The From3 point is the 3D location we're looking from.  The 3D point
    we're looking at is given by the To3 point.  The 3D up direction is
    given by the 3D Up3 vector and the 3D viewing angle is given by the
    Vangle3 parameter.  The viewing angle value must be in the range of
    0 to 180, exclusive.

        The 4D viewing parameters are similar to the 3D viewing
    parameters except for the additional Over4 parameter.  Because of the
    extra degree of freedom in four-space, we need an additional view
    vector to specify the orientation of view.  The Over4 vector must not
    be parallel to the Up4 vector or the line of sight.




Running Wire4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        `wire4' can be run in two ways.  If it's called with command-line
    arguments, it opens up the object description file specified on the
    command line.  If it's called without arguments, it reads in the
    object description from the standard input stream.

        Interactive controls consist of the horizontal mouse movement,
    and either the three mouse buttons or the keyboard.




Projection Modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Both the 3D and 4D projection modes can take on one of two forms:
    parallel projection or perspective projection.  In perspective
    projection, objects that are further away appear smaller than objects
    that are closer.  With parallel projection, objects do not diminish
    in size as they move farther away.

        The projection modes can be set in the object input file with the
    Project3 and Project4 keywords.  The argument for these statements
    may be either "Parallel" or "Perspective".  For example:

        |  Project4  Perspective
        |  Project3  Parallel

        Additionally, the projection modes can be selected interactively.
    It's often helpful to toggle this interactively to try to get a
    handle on the structure of a 4D object, although it can also further
    confuse you  =^).

        The projection modes can be controlled by the mouse buttons or by
    the keyboard.
    
        To toggle the 3D projection mode via mouse buttons, hold down the
    right mouse button and click the left mouse button.  Pressing the '3'
    key also toggles the 3D projection mode.

        To toggle the 4D projection mode via mouse buttons, hold down the
    right mouse button and click the middle mouse button.  You can also
    toggle the 4D projection mode by pressing the '4' key.

        The current projection modes will be displayed in the proper
    status boxes on the right side of the display screen.

        You can also display the outline of the intermediate 3D projection
    region with the "RefCube" statement in the input file (as in "RefCube
    On" or "Refcube Off"), or interactively by pressing the 'r' key.  The
    display of the intermediate projection region is helpful because it
    helps you to distinguish between 3D rotations and 4D rotations
    without looking away from the object display.




Object Rotation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        The object can be rotated interactively via the horizontal
    movement of the mouse.  There are nine possible rotations of the
    object view:  six for the 4D view of the object and three for the 3D
    view of the 4D projection.

        To select the proper rotation, you first need to select the
    rotation space (3D or 4D).  This can be done by clicking the middle
    mouse button or by pressing the 's' key.  The current rotation space
    will be displayed at the right side of the display screen.

        To select the rotation plane, you can click the left mouse button
    or press the 'p' key.  The 3D rotation planes are XY, YZ and ZX.  The
    4D rotation planes are XY, YZ, ZX, XW, YW, and ZW.  The current
    rotation plane will be displayed at the right side of the display
    screen.




Depthcueing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        The 4D object can also be displayed with 4D depthcueing.  The
    depthcueing is based on the 4D W eye-coordinate.  Typically, objects
    that are farther away are rendered with darker colors and objects
    that are closer are rendered with lighter colors to simulate objects
    that fade with distance.

        Interactively, depthcueing can be toggled on and off by pressing
    the 'd' key.  Depthcueing can also be initially on or off via the
    "DepthCue" statement in the input file, e.g.:

        |  DepthCue  on

        or

        |  DepthCue  off

        The depthcue parameters are given in the input file.  The first
    parameters are the color of the nearest points and the color of the
    farthest points.  These are controlled by the ColorNear and ColorFar
    parameters, e.g.:

        |  ColorNear:  255  20  20        # Red means close.
        |  ColorFar :   20 255  20        # Green means far.

        or

        |  ColorNear   255 255 255        # White means close.
        |  ColorFar     50  50  50        # Dark grey means far.

        Each edge drawn will be gradated into some number of segments to
    simulate a gradation from a near color to a far color.  The number
    of segments for each edge is 16 by default, but can be set with the
    DepthCueLevels statement in the input file.  For example,

        |  DepthCueLevels  5

    will set the number of gradations per edge to 5.  Obviously, the
    more the gradations, the slower the display.

        The final depthcue parameters deal with the range of depthcueing.
    If the near and far depthcue distances are not given in the input
    file, they will automatically be chosen so that the object best fills
    the depthcue region.  To get the widest range, the near distance
    would be the distance to the closest vertex and the far distance
    would be the distance to the farthest vertex.  However, the near and
    far planes can be set in the input file as well.  Locations farther
    than the far distance will all be given the ColorFar color, and
    locations closer than the near distance will all be assigned the
    ColorNear color.  You may wish to set the near location to somewhere
    inside the object or closer than the closest point on the object.

        For example, if you set both the near and far depthcue distances
    to the distance of the center of the object, then half of the object
    would be colored with the ColorNear color and half of the object
    would be colored with the ColorFar color.  This would have the effect
    of imitating a cutting plane through the object perpendicular to the
    line of sight.

        The depthcue distance parameters are set with the DepthFar and
    DepthNear keywords, e.g.:

        |  DepthFar   100.0
        |  DepthNear  -10.0

        Again, if you don't know what distances to choose, you can just
    leave out these statements to have wire4 determine a good range for
    you.




Image Snapshots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        For hardcopy display purposes, I added a snapshot feature to this
    program.  This feature captures the current 2D object image and adds
    it to a file called "snapshots".  The current viewing parameters are
    given as lines preceded with the '#' character, and the 2D edges are
    given as a series of "M <Real [0,1]> <Real [0,1]>" (move) commands
    and "D <Real [0,1]> <Real [0,1]>" (draw) commands.

        You can use the `psplot' program to convert this file to a simple
    PostScript file.  For more information, refer to psplot.doc.

        To append the current image to the snapshots file, press the 'c'
    key.
