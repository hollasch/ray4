File:  r4_image.h

    This file contains structure and constant declarations for the ray4
image file output format.

    The following assumptions are made in the header structure:

    - All fields are packed together (no space between fields).
    - uchar  fields are unsigned  8-bit integers.
    - ushort fields are unsigned 16-bit integers.
    - ulong  fields are unsigned 32-bit integers.

    The fields are as follows:

    magic       :  Always set to 'Ray4' (0x52977934).
    version     :  Lower is older.  Currently set to 1.
    bitsperpixel:  Total bits for each pixel - red, green & blue.
    aspect      :  Aspect ratio.  To form a perfect cube with all edges
                   of equal length, it would be aspect[0] pixels in the
                   X dimension, aspect[1] pixels in the Y dimension, and
                   aspect[2] pixels in the Z dimension.
    first       :  Starting corner of the image cube.
    last        :  Ending corner of the image cube.  The dimension of
                   the data is (last[0]-first[0]+1) horizontally,
                   (last[1]-first[1]+1) vertically, and (last[2]-first[2]
                   +1) deep.

    The header structure size will be a multiple of longwords.

    After the header follows the image data.  Each scanline consists of RGB
triples, where each triple is `bitsperpixel' long.  Scanlines are stored left
to right, top to bottom, back to front.  All scanlines begin on even byte
boundaries.
