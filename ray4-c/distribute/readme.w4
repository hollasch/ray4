    This is the initial release of my 4D wireframe viewer that I wrote for
my master's thesis, "Four-Space Visualization of 4D Objects", in May 1991.
The thesis is also available from whatever means you got this package, or
you can send me e-mail and I'll forward a copy to you.

    Please send me e-mail to let me know if you're using this package so
I can add you to my mailing list.  This way I can send out patches and
upgrades and be fairly confident that the folks that need them will get
them.  I'll also try to pass along any useful tips or comments that I
receive.

    This release should include the following files:

    You will probably need to tweak the makefile to get it to run on
your platform.  I've tried to make this as straightforward as possible,
but let me know if you have problems.

    Wire4 supports wireframe display of arbitrary 4D objects (from ASCII
input files) and displays objects with user-specified edge colors,
depth-cueing, and interactive 3D and 4D rotation.  Both 4D to 3D and
3D to 2D projections can be interactively set to parallel or perspective
projection.  Also included in the package is a program to generate
simple PostScript files of arbitrary wireframe views.

    Wire4 uses the GL library, so it is mostly useful for SGI boxes,
although other platforms that have a GL compatibility library may also run
the program.

    Also available for release is my 4D raytracing program.  Let me know
if you are interested and I'll send you a copy.  Ray4 runs on any platform
that supports C and floating point, but currently the only display
programs available are for the Amiga, SGI platforms, and Sun rasterfiles.

    Finally, I'd like to acknowledge and thank the folks who volunteered
to beta-test this software for me:

        Greg Aharonian
        Brian Carney
        Mark Ferneau
        Marty Ryan
