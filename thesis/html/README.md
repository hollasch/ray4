HTML Source for "Four-Space Visualization of 4D Objects"
====================================================================================================

This directory contains the HTML version of the thesis as a file-for-file conversion from the
original `troff` source. It's kept here for historical reference, but most readers should instead
see the modern (single-file) HTML version:
[Four-Space Visualization of 4D Objects](../../docs/Four-Space_Visualization_of_4D_Objects.html)
